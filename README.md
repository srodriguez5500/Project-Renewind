# Project-Renewind
Project: "ReneWind" is a company working on improving the machinery/processes involved in the production of wind energy using machine learning and has collected data of generator failure of wind turbines using sensors. The objective is to build various classification models, tune them and find the best one that will help identify failures so that the generator could be repaired before failing/breaking and the overall maintenance cost of the generators can be brought down.

# Skills and Tools Covered
Hyperparameter tuning, oversampling, undersampling, regularization, pipelines

# My Learnings:
This was a very interesting project because I was able to interact with a dataset, where the features were ciphered. It was insightful to see how you can still extract meaningful data, despite not knowing what the features mean. This was a great example of how data speaks for itself, when analyzed thoroughly. I was able to discover which attributes were strong indicators of failing generators and was able to provide thresholds of feature values that were associated with failing generators. The model development process included general preprocessing, splitting the data into training and validation sets, applying undersampling and oversampling techniques, tuning hyperparameters using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV, and finally, creating a pipeline to facilitate deployment and prepare the final model for production.
